"""
anota_taint_test.py

Ad-hoc tests for the ANOTA_TAINT taint-tracking API and its integration
with the instrumented CPython interpreter.

Intended usage (from the ANOTA-instrumented build root):

    ./python anota_taint_test.py

These tests assume:

- A builtin called ANOTA_TAINT is available (implemented by _PyAnota_Taint),
  with the signature:

      ANOTA_TAINT(obj, sanitization=[hash], Sink=[print])

- Taint is enforced via _PyAnotaTaint_CheckVectorcall /
  _PyAnotaTaint_CheckTupleDictCall, which raise RuntimeError on violations.

- Sanitizers (e.g. hash) clear taint on their return values when called
  with tainted inputs, via _PyAnotaTaint_PostCall.
