# ANOTA Instrumentation Guide

This repository extends CPython 3.10 with a family of ANOTA security hooks. The goal of this document is to describe each component’s purpose, public interface, the available test scripts, and explain how to build the instrumented interpreter.

## Hardening & Stability (MAC-DAST Fork)

This fork introduces significant hardening to the original ANOTA base:

- **C-Level Hashtables**: `ANOTA_TAINT` and `ANOTA_WATCH` now use `_Py_hashtable_t` instead of Python dictionaries. This prevents infinite recursion during hash checks and provides native support for **unhashable objects** (e.g., lists, dicts, custom objects).
- **Dealloc Hooks**: Injected `NotifyDealloc` triggers into `Objects/object.c`. Policies and taint metadata are now automatically cleared when an object is destroyed, preventing **address-reuse vulnerabilities**.
- **Recursion Guards**: All C hooks implement recursion protection and error state preservation (`PyErr_Fetch`/`Restore`) to ensure interpreter stability during complex object deallocations.
- **Enhanced Propagation**: Patched `ceval.c` (`FORMAT_VALUE`, `BUILD_STRING`) to ensure taint is correctly propagated through f-strings and string joins.

### New APIs

- `ANOTA_TAINT_CLEAR()`: Resets the global taint table.
- `deep_is_tainted(obj)`: Recursively checks nested containers (lists-in-lists, dicts) for tainted members with cycle detection.

## Building the Interpreter

The project follows CPython’s normal build layout. The steps below assume a Debian/Ubuntu-style environment; adjust package names as needed for other platforms.

### 1. Install System Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
    build-essential \
    gdb \
    lcov \
    libbz2-dev \
    libffi-dev \
    libgdbm-dev \
    liblzma-dev \
    libncursesw5-dev \
    libnss3-dev \
    libreadline-dev \
    libsqlite3-dev \
    libssl-dev \
    tk-dev \
    uuid-dev \
    zlib1g-dev
```

These match the packages recommended by `Doc/README.rst` for building Python with all optional modules enabled.

### 2. Configure

From the repository root:

```bash
./configure --enable-optimizations --with-lto
```

- `--enable-optimizations` enables profile-guided optimizations (PGO).
- `--with-lto` turns on link-time optimization when supported by the toolchain.

Use `./configure --help` to inspect additional options (e.g., `--with-pydebug` for a debug build).

### 3. Build

```bash
make -j"$(nproc)"
```

### 4. Run Tests

Run the standard CPython regression suite:

```bash
make test
```

For the ANOTA features specifically, execute:

```bash
./python anota_object_access_test.py
./python anota_taint_test.py
./python anota_syscall_test.py
```

### 5. Optional Installation

If you want to install the instrumented interpreter system-wide (not usually required for development):

```bash
sudo make altinstall
```

`altinstall` avoids overwriting the system’s default `python3`.

### 6. Optional Syscall Monitor Integration

The Rust daemon under `syscall-module/` requires the nightly toolchain because
its dependencies currently target `edition2024`. Install it once via

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly
```

Then run the end-to-end integration test:

```bash
./python anota_syscall_integration_test.py
```

The script automatically builds the daemon using `cargo +nightly` and exercises
the `ANOTA_SYSCALL_SIGNAL_START/STOP` helpers.

Note: the Aya crates required by the daemon are vendored under
`syscall-module/aya-src`, so no network access or git submodules are necessary.

### Syscall Tracepoint Overview

The Rust crate at `syscall-module/syscall-tracepoint/` provides the low-level
syscall monitors used by the daemon. It attaches to Linux syscall tracepoints,
collects per-call metadata, and forwards events through the shared types in
`syscall-tracepoint-common` to the rest of the workspace. You typically do not
need to touch it directly—building the daemon or running the integration tests
automatically compiles the tracepoint code alongside its eBPF helpers.

## 1. ANOTA_EXECUTION (`Python/anota_execution.c`)

### Usage Summary

`ANOTA_EXECUTION` provides a single guard primitive:

```python
ANOTA_EXECUTION.BLOCK(condition, msg=None)
```

- If `condition` is truthy, execution continues normally.
- If it is falsy, a `RuntimeError` is raised (optionally containing `msg`), allowing you to stop unsafe flows early.

Typical use cases:

- Hardening privilege checks (`ANOTA_EXECUTION.BLOCK(user.is_admin)`).
- Preventing optional code from running when prerequisites are missing.

---

## 2. ANOTA_WATCH (`Python/anota_watch.c`)

### Usage Summary

`ANOTA_WATCH` lets you gate reads (`R`), writes (`W`), and execution (`X`) against specific objects or their members:

```python
ANOTA_WATCH.ALLOW(obj, "RW", key=None)
ANOTA_WATCH.BLOCK(obj, "X", key=None)
ANOTA_WATCH.CLEAR(obj, key=None)
ANOTA_WATCH.CLEAR_ALL()
```

- Use `ALLOW` when you want to specify the exact set of modes that remain permitted; everything else is implicitly denied.
- Use `BLOCK` for one-off denials.
- Provide `key` (attribute name, dict key, index, etc.) to scope policies to individual fields.
- `CLEAR`/`CLEAR_ALL` remove policies so code can proceed normally again.

---

## 3. ANOTA_TAINT (`Python/anota_taint.c`)

### Usage Summary

```python
ANOTA_TAINT(obj, sanitization=[hash], Sink=[print])
```

- `obj` becomes tainted and will propagate warnings if it reaches listed sinks.
- Any function listed under `sanitization` clears taint on its return value.
- Any function listed under `Sink` raises `RuntimeError` when called with tainted arguments.
- Ideal for hardening serialization routines, dangerous exports, or command execution helpers.

---

## 4. ANOTA_SYSCALL (`Python/anota_syscall.c`)

### Usage Summary

`ANOTA_SYSCALL` lets you monitor file, process, and network operations issued through CPython’s standard wrappers. Policies can be written globally or scoped to a particular operation:

```python
ANOTA_SYSCALL.READ.BLOCK(PATH="/etc/passwd")
ANOTA_SYSCALL.READ.ALLOW(PATH="/var/log/")
ANOTA_SYSCALL.CONNECT.BLOCK(DOMAIN="*.example.com")
ANOTA_SYSCALL.CONNECT.BLOCK(IP="10.*")
ANOTA_SYSCALL.SOCKET.BLOCK(PROTOCOL="TCP")
```

- Accepted keywords: `PATH`, `DOMAIN`, `IP`, `PROTOCOL`. Supply only one per call.
- Wildcards (`*`) are supported in all fields. Append `/` to a path to match an entire directory tree.
- Global controls: `ANOTA_SYSCALL.ALLOW("execve")`, `ANOTA_SYSCALL.BLOCK("open", "execv")`.
- Violations are logged to stderr so you can review which syscall and target triggered the policy.
- System-wide collection is driven by the Rust daemon in `syscall-module`. Use helper functions such as `ANOTA_SYSCALL_SIGNAL_START(pid=None)` / `ANOTA_SYSCALL_SIGNAL_STOP()` to send `START`/`STOP` commands to `/tmp/anota_syscall.sock` and bracket the region you want to trace.

## 5. Test Suites

### 5.1 `anota_object_access_test.py`

- Exercises ANOTA_WATCH and ANOTA_EXECUTION behavior.
- Run with the instrumented interpreter:

  ```
  ./python anota_object_access_test.py
  ```

- Coverage:
  - Object-level read/execution policies and their interaction with bytecode opcodes.
  - Attribute and subscript read/write policies.
  - Mode allow-mask semantics.

### 5.2 `anota_taint_test.py`

- Validates ANOTA_TAINT hook behavior.
- Run with:

  ```
  ./python anota_taint_test.py
  ```

- Coverage:
  - Registering tainted objects.
  - Ensuring sinks raise on tainted inputs.
  - Sanitizer propagation and clearing.
  - Helper assertions: `expect_runtime_error`, etc.

### 5.3 `anota_syscall_test.py`

- Smoke-tests the ANOTA_SYSCALL controller in a non-fatal way (violations log but do not stop execution).
- Run with:

  ```
  ./python anota_syscall_test.py
  ```

- Tests include:
  - Blocking global syscalls like `open`.
  - File/directory path policies (exact, directory prefixes, wildcards).
  - Allow-list enforcement.
  - Process execution monitoring (`execv`).
  - Network policies (domain/IP allow/deny with wildcards).
- Protocol-level blocking (`SOCKET` policy).

### 5.4 `anota_syscall_signal_test.py`

- Validates the `ANOTA_SYSCALL_SIGNAL_START/STOP` helpers that talk to the Rust monitoring daemon.
- Run with:

  ```
  ./python anota_syscall_signal_test.py
  ```

- The script spins up a dummy UNIX socket server in `/tmp/anota_syscall.sock` and ensures the helpers emit `START [pid]` and `STOP` commands without errors.

### 5.5 `anota_syscall_integration_test.py`

- Builds (if necessary) and launches the Rust daemon in `syscall-module`, then exercises the Python `ANOTA_SYSCALL_SIGNAL_START/STOP` helpers against the real control socket.
- Run with:

  ```
  ./python anota_syscall_integration_test.py
  ```

- The script sets `ANOTA_SYSCALL_SKIP_EBPF=1` so no root privileges are required; it focuses on the control-plane integration.

### 5.6 Additional Coverage

- Interpreter bytecode tests (e.g., `test_nested_sink.py`, `test_taint_propagation.py`) integrate the taint hooks into real call flows.
- When modifying policies, use the dedicated tests above to validate behavior, then run the broader CPython regression suite as needed.

## Usage Notes

1. Always launch the custom interpreter (`./python`) so that the ANOTA singletons are available in `builtins`.
2. Policies persist within a process; call `ANOTA_* .clear()` between tests or when updating configuration at runtime.
3. Violations generally log to stderr and raise `RuntimeError` only for ANOTA_TAINT and ANOTA_EXECUTION. ANOTA_SYSCALL currently logs without raising.
4. Wildcards can be used in PATH, DOMAIN, IP, and PROTOCOL values. For directory scopes, add a trailing slash to enforce prefix matching.
